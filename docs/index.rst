🎯 Why You Might Want to Cancel
-------------------------------

Before we get to the how-to, let’s quickly talk about the *why*. Everyone’s reason is different, but here are a few common ones:

- You found another streaming service that better fits your needs

🔑 Know Before You Cancel
-------------------------

Before canceling, log in to your Sling account and check your billing cycle. This helps you know how much time is left before your next charge. When you **sling account cancel**, your access will usually continue through the end of your current paid period. So if you just renewed recently, you can still watch until your plan ends.

Also, canceling stops automatic payments. You won’t be charged again unless you reactivate. It’s a good idea to keep a screenshot or note of your cancellation confirmation just in case. 📝🛑

- Follow the prompts to confirm your cancellation.

During the cancellation process, Sling may ask why you’re leaving and offer you a discount or free trial to stay. If you’re sure, just continue the process.
